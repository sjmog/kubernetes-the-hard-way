# Installing the Client Tools

In this lab you will install the command line utilities required to complete this tutorial: [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl), [cfssljson](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl), and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl).

> Now go find out what cfssl and kubectl are.

- :bulb: read [this Wikipedia page on TLS-PSK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS-PSK) since it is an important topic in networking.
- :pencil: Summarise what CFSSL is, showing you understand how it relates to PSK/TLS.
- :pencil: Summarise what kubectl is. You don't need to find out what a "Kubernetes cluster" is yet.

## Install CFSSL

The `cfssl` and `cfssljson` command line utilities will be used to provision a [PKI Infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure) and generate TLS certificates.

Download and install `cfssl` and `cfssljson`:

### OS X

```
curl -o cfssl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-the-hard-way/cfssl/darwin/cfssl
curl -o cfssljson https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-the-hard-way/cfssl/darwin/cfssljson
```

```
chmod +x cfssl cfssljson
```

```
sudo mv cfssl cfssljson /usr/local/bin/
```

Some OS X users may experience problems using the pre-built binaries in which case [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) might be a better option:

```
brew install cfssl
```

### Linux

```
wget -q --show-progress --https-only --timestamping \
  https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-the-hard-way/cfssl/linux/cfssl \
  https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-the-hard-way/cfssl/linux/cfssljson
```

```
chmod +x cfssl cfssljson
```

```
sudo mv cfssl cfssljson /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verification

Verify `cfssl` and `cfssljson` version 1.3.4 or higher is installed:

```
cfssl version
```

> output

```
Version: 1.3.4
Revision: dev
Runtime: go1.13
```

```
cfssljson --version
```
```
Version: 1.3.4
Revision: dev
Runtime: go1.13
```

## Install kubectl

The `kubectl` command line utility is used to interact with the Kubernetes API Server. Download and install `kubectl` from the official release binaries:

### OS X

```
curl -o kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.3/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
```

```
chmod +x kubectl
```

```
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Linux

```
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.3/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```

```
chmod +x kubectl
```

```
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Verification

Verify `kubectl` version 1.15.3 or higher is installed:

```
kubectl version --client
```

> output

```
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"15", GitVersion:"v1.15.3", GitCommit:"2d3c76f9091b6bec110a5e63777c332469e0cba2", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-08-19T11:13:54Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.9", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```
